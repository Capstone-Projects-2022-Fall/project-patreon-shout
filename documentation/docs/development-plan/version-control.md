# Version Control

* GitHub will be used as the version control system for Patreon Shout
* Branch protection will be utilized to prevent direct pushes to the main branch, requiring at least one review (but
  preferring all 3 members). This ensures that the main branch always remains a safe, reliable, and deployable codebase.
* Each task/feature will have its own branch for a group member to work on. A consistent naming scheme utilizing Jiraâ€™s
  Issue Tags will be implemented to facilitate tracking.
* Branches will be kept up-to-date and merged regularly with the staging branch to minimize the occurrence of merge
  conflicts.
* Each feature will be pushed to a master branch upon completion.
