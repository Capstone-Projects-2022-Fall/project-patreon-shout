## Project Overview

This document proposes a web application that allows content creators to have their Patreon posts automatically sent to other social platforms. Non-content creator users of this web application will also be able to see the posts of the Patreon creators they follow. This will improve creator outreach to users of the web application by showing recommended creators to follow.



## High Level Requirement

Describe the requirements – i.e., what the product does and how it does it from a user point of view – at a high level.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
